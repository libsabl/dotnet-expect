# Sabl.Expect

Implementation of `expect(...).to` test assertion pattern for dotnet. Implemented as a thin wrapper over [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions).

### Naming and conventions

This package is not authored by the FluentAssertions team, but is structured according to FluentAssertions project conventions so that it could be easily adopted by that project if they so desired at some point in the future. Likewise, the published package name is `Sabl.Expect` to avoid any ambiguity in authorship and support, but the root namespace is `FluentAssertions.Expectations` for best compatibility in source code.
